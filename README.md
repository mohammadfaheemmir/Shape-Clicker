# Shape-Clicker
This project is an interactive shape clicker game that challenges users to click on a randomly appearing shape as quickly as possible. The game records the time taken to click on each shape, providing a fun and engaging way to test and improve reaction times. Ideal for both casual users and developers interested in game mechanics.
